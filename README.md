Problem Set for week 1 - Strings, Types, Functions

Homework 1 Covers Strings, Types, and Functions in python. Make sure you solve the problems in python 2.7, or else our autograder will not be able to intepret your solutions. Here is some documentation to learn the material:

## Python Functions
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/functions.html

## Python Types
http://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types
https://docs.python.org/2/library/types.html

## String Manipulation
https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm

I will be covering these topics again briefly in lecture 2, due to the fact that we ran out of time during lecture 1 because of the Interview microlesson!

### Testing
For hw1, we added a small test suite for you to test your code against. This is not an exhaustive test suite and does not cover all edge cases, but it should be a good starting point. If you pass all of the test cases built into the homework, you should expect to get a reasonably good grade on the homework assignment. The test cases for each question are located on the docstring under the method header. To run the entire test suite at once, run the following command on the root directory inside your terminal (if you don't know how to use bash, read this tutorial: http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php. We will be covering bash in more depth, but this should be enough to get you started!).

$ python hw1.py -v

### Help
There will be no formal office hours this week. Starting next week, office hours will be held immediately after your Hackerspace section for 1 hour. If you have any questions, post them on Piazza or Slack on channel #slackOverflow.

### Bugs
If you find any bugs, message me #achungsta or Ananya #ananyacleetus  on slack!
